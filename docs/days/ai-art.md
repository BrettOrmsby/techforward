::: warning
You are ethically responsible for the images you generate. **DO NOT** prompt for any images that are inappropriate for school, are damaging to other people, cultures, races or display any other unethical content. You may accidentally get inappropriate (likely revealing) content from the prompts, but you are responsible for not using that content.

### Crafting A Good Prompt

1. **Subject** - The main thing you want to see in the image
2. **Medium** - Material used to create the image (oil painting)
3. **Style** - Artistic style of the artwork (impressionist)
4. **Artist** - Real artists names to make image based off their work
5. **Website** - Some websites might makes the artwork better (artstation)
6. **Resolution** - How sharp and detailed the image is (highly detailed)
7. **Additional details** - More details to change some image features (fantasy)
8. **Color** - Colours to see in the image or objects
9. **Lighting** - Type of lighting to appear in the image (bright)

### Tips

- Use the [negative prompt](#negative-prompt)
- Start with few keywords (subject, medium and style)
- Check the efficiency of a keyword by using it alone as a prompt first
- Only add keywords a max of 2 at a time
